      This reference platform Configuration for AWS Lambda
      is a starting point to build, run, and operate A Serverless
      abstraction and offer a self-service capability to your internal teams.
      
      The overall Composition supports the use case of querying SSM parameters
      and using the values for infrastructure Provisioning. This reference platform
      includes an XBucket Composition for creating S3 Buckets, XParameter for defining
      SSM parameters, XFunction for creating a Lambda Function, and XFunctionDeployment
      for uploading a zip file to a bucket and creating a Lambda function.
      This Configuration uses cloud Lambda service primitives from the [Upbound Official AWS
      Provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-aws).

      To learn more checkout the [GitHub
      repo](https://github.com/upbound/platform-ref-lambda/) that you can copy and
      customize to meet the exact needs of your organization!
